				"One of the most impressive elements of “Kubo and the Two Strings”—besides its dazzling stop-motion animation, its powerful performances and its transporting score—is the amount of credit it gives its audience, particularly its younger viewers." <br> <strong>-Roger Ebert 4.5/5 stars</strong>

				""If you must blink," a voice says over the soundtrack, "do it now." Consider this sound advice for anyone who's just entered the stop-motion world of this late-summer fantasy: Close your eyes for a nanosecond, and you might miss the sort of visually mind-blowing shot or part of a sweeping, how-the-hell-did-they-do-that set piece that causes Pavlovian salivating. Take, for example, the opening sequence that occurs right after that line, in which a woman in a boat is buffeted by angry, violent waves. What appears to be a giant tsunami starts to rise in front of her, blocking out a bright, full moon. Suddenly, she lifts her hand and strums down, fast, on a banjo-like shamisen. The power chord parts the sea like Moses. Once she's washed up on the beach, a one-eyed baby appears out of a knapsack. Less than five minutes have passed. You have not caught your breath yet." <br> <strong>-Rolling Stone 10/10</strong>

				"Kubo offers visceral thrills and visual splendor, but it also champions the importance of kindness, forgiveness, and embracing humanity's many imperfections." <br> <strong>-Rotten Tomatoes 97/100</strong>
